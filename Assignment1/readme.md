# README.md

## Introduction
This directory contains code snippets in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file demonstrating various mathematical functions and their graphical representations using Python libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib.

## Contents
- **Assignment_1.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook file containing Python code snippets.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the repository and instructions.

## Usage
To run the code in the Jupyter Notebook, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the required libraries. You can execute the code cell by cell or all at once. 

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
'pip install numpy', 'pip install matplotlib'
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`Assignment_1.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Execute the code cells by pressing Shift + Enter.

## Code Overview
The code snippets in the notebook demonstrate the following mathematical functions and their graphical representations:

1. Linear function: \( y = wx + b \)
2. Quadratic function: \( y = x^2 \)
3. Sigmoid function: \( y = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \)
4. Hyperbolic tangent function: \( y = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}} \)
5. Composition of functions: \( y = g(f(x)) \), where \( f(x) = wx + b \) and \( g(u) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-u}} \)
6. Composition of different functions: \( y = g(f(x)) \), where \( f(x) = wx + b \), \( g_1(u) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-u}} \), and \( g_2(u) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-u}} \), and \( g_3(w) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-w}} \)
